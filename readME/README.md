## Description
This project was built to test my knowledge and skills on Javascript. I have learned how important JS is to webpages from this project and have slightly seen the power of it. This project has helped me understand functions, var, and if statements better. I learned what the return action can do. This project has also taught me the importance of needing to figure out solutions on my own, there is not always going to be a teacher to ask a question about. I had to do my own research on math.floor and math.random actions. Though i still don't fully understand them i was able to get them to work and i will continue to learn about them until it clicks. I also used pseudo coding to my advantage for the first time and understand why it is essential for developers. It helped me keep track of what i was working on and helped me if i thought i was forgetting something.
